// GptpClockOps — user-supplied clock and timestamping operations.
//
// This interface is the sole contact point between the gPTP slave
// follower core and the underlying hardware/OS. The state machines
// depend only on this struct; they never call platform APIs directly.
//
// This layering lets the same core code run on Linux (raw packet
// socket + SO_TIMESTAMPING + PHC via clock_adjtime), on bare metal
// with a custom PTP hardware clock, or on software-only systems for
// testing.
//
// Every field is a std::function so the caller can bind lambdas
// capturing their own state (e.g. a PHC fd, a ring buffer of tx
// timestamp requests, a soft-clock driver state).
