# MRP / MSRP / MVRP State Machines

This document describes the IEEE 802.1Q-2014 Multiple Registration Protocol
(MRP) implementation in `statusbar/tsn/` and how it is used by the
MSRP (Clause 35) and MVRP (Clause 11.2) participant classes.

## Scope

- **Local endpoint only.** Not bridge-capable. A single participant
  instance represents one end of a point-to-point MRP relationship on
  one NIC (one 802.1Q "port"). Per-port state; no forwarding logic.
- **No daemon, no sockets, no management surface.** The participant is
  an in-process library. PDU I/O is via user-supplied callbacks
  (`set_send_pdu`) and explicit `receive_pdu()` calls. Timers are
  driven by `tick()` and exposed via `next_deadline()` for integration
  with any event loop.
- **No MMRP.** MAC multicast registration is out of scope for this
  endpoint implementation.
- **`operPointToPointMAC = true`** is hardcoded, which collapses the
  shared-media branches in the Applicant FSM's `rJoinIn!` and `rIn!`
  transitions per Clause 10.7.7 Table 10-3 notes 4-7. A point-to-point
  link is the only supported topology for a local AVB endpoint.

Reference implementation during porting: OpenAvnu mrpd at
`stash/avnu/OpenAvnu/daemons/mrpd/`. Line-number citations throughout
the code point back to `mrpd/mrp.c` for auditability.

## The four state machines

All four FSMs are expressed as compile-time `TransitionTable<Def>` constants
using the `statusbar::sm` framework. Each transition is a
`Transition{next_state, action_fn, valid}` cell in a 2D array indexed by
`[State][Event]`. Invalid cells (no table entry) result in a no-op —
equivalent to the `default: break;` fall-through used by `mrp.c`.

### Applicant FSM — `mrp_applicant_sm.hpp`

- **12 states** (per Clause 10.7.7 Table 10-2): `Vo`, `Vp`, `Vn`, `An`, `Aa`, `Qa`,
  `La`, `Ao`, `Qo`, `Ap`, `Qp`, `Lo`. Plus a `Start` pseudo-state that
  transitions via UCT to `Vo` on BEGIN!
- **Events**: `New`, `Join`, `Leave`, `TxLeaveAll`, `TxLeaveAllFull`,
  `RNew`, `RJoinIn`, `RIn`, `RJoinMt`, `RMt`, `RLeave`, `RLeaveAll`,
  `Redeclare`, `Periodic`, plus the two `Tx` variants described below.
- **One cross-FSM coupling.** Clause 10.7.7 Note 8 specifies that on
  the `tx!` event from state `An`, the next state depends on whether
  the paired *Registrar* is in `In`. With `p2pmac = true` this is the
  only runtime-dependent transition in the entire Applicant FSM. It is
  resolved by splitting the single `tx!` event into two variants:
  - `TxRegistrarIn` — fired when the paired Registrar is `In`
  - `TxRegistrarMt` — fired when the paired Registrar is `Lv` or `Mt`
  The participant driver picks which variant to dispatch; only the
  `An` cell differs between the two columns.
- **Side-effect outputs.** Each transmit-producing transition writes
  three fields into `applicant_sm::Context`:
  - `tx_pending` (bool) — this attribute wants to be included in the
    next outgoing PDU
  - `send_msg` (enum) — internal sndmsg intent: `New` / `Join` / `In` / `Leave`
  - `encode` (enum) — `Required` or `Optional`
  The `send_msg` is an internal code, not a wire `AttributeEvent`. The
  participant's transmit path translates it at encode time using the
  paired Registrar's current state (`Join` → `JoinIn` / `JoinMt`; `In` → `In` / `Mt`).
  This preserves `mrp.c`'s two-phase encoding and keeps the two FSMs
  loosely coupled.

See `mrp_applicant_sm.hpp` for the full table, cross-referenced to
`mrp.c:551-904` line ranges per event.

### Registrar FSM — `mrp_registrar_sm.hpp`

- **3 states**: `In`, `Lv`, `Mt`. Plus `Start` (UCT → `Mt`).
- **Events**: `RNew`, `RJoinIn`, `RJoinMt`, `RLeave`, `RLeaveAll`,
  `TxLeaveAll`, `Redeclare`, `LvTimer`, `Flush`. (`rIn!` and `rMt!`
  are intentionally ignored per Clause 10.7.8.)
- **Side-effect outputs** in `registrar_sm::Context`:
  - `notify` (enum) — `None` / `New` / `Join` / `Leave`
  - `lvtimer_request` (bool) — when true, the participant starts the
    per-port LeaveTimer (idempotent if already running)
- **Asymmetric self-loop behaviour.** A subtle point inherited from
  `mrp.c`: `rNew!` on state `In` *does* set `notify = New` (self-loop
  with a side effect). `rJoinIn!` / `rJoinMt!` on state `In` does *not*
  set `notify` (silent refresh). This asymmetry is preserved
  intentionally — the rNew self-loop is encoded in the table with an
  action; the rJoinIn/rJoinMt IN cell is simply absent.

### LeaveAll Timer FSM — `mrp_leaveall_sm.hpp`

- **2 states**: `Passive`, `Active`. Plus `Start` (UCT → `Passive`).
- One instance per port per protocol. Periodically flips to `Active`,
  at which point the next TX pass sends the PDU with the LeaveAll
  flag set, then flips back to `Passive`.
- LeaveAll interval is randomized in `[0.5×LAT, 1.5×LAT)` per Clause
  10.7.4.2, using a `TimerScheduler`-owned `std::mt19937_64` seeded
  deterministically for tests.

### Periodic Transmission FSM — `mrp_periodic_sm.hpp`

- **2 states**: `Passive`, `Active`. Plus `Start` (UCT → `Active`).
- One instance per port per protocol. Controls whether the 1-second
  Periodic timer is rearmed after each fire. When `Active`, each
  Periodic expiry dispatches a `Periodic` event to every attribute's
  Applicant, which triggers the `Qa → Aa` and `Qp → Ap` transitions
  that keep quiet attributes re-announcing.

## Timer scheduler — `mrp_timers.hpp`

`TimerScheduler` tracks four deadline-based timers as `std::optional<TimePoint>`
fields:

| Timer       | Duration                 | Clause       |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| JoinTimer   | 100 ms                   | 10.7.4.1     |
| LeaveTimer  | 1000 ms                  | 10.7.4.3     |
| LeaveAllTimer | randomized 5–15 s      | 10.7.4.2     |
| PeriodicTimer | 1000 ms                | 10.7.5.23    |

### Operations

- `start_*(now)` — idempotent; no-op if already running (matches `mrp.c`)
- `arm_*(now)` — force-(re)arm; always resets the deadline
- `stop_*()` — stops if running
- `next_deadline()` — earliest deadline across all running timers, or
  `TimePoint::max()` if none. Use this to schedule a `poll`/`epoll`
  wait in the caller's event loop.
- `tick(now)` — returns an `Expired` struct reporting which timers
  have expired; expired timers are automatically cleared (the caller
  is responsible for rearming based on FSM outputs).

The scheduler is not thread-safe; a participant is assumed to run on
a single event-loop thread.

## Attribute record — `mrp_attribute.hpp`

```cpp
template <typename FirstValue>
struct AttributeRecord {
    FirstValue first_value;              // wire-format payload
    Operation operation;                 // Register | Declare
    applicant_sm::Context applicant_ctx; // tx_pending, send_msg, encode
    applicant_sm::Machine applicant_sm;  // current state
    registrar_sm::Context registrar_ctx; // notify, lvtimer_request
    registrar_sm::Machine registrar_sm;  // current state
    bool should_reclaim;
};
```

Helpers: `registrar_is_in()` for picking the TX event variant, and
`is_dead()` (`Applicant == Vo && Registrar == Mt`) for reclaim sweeps.

MSRP's Listener type needs an extra `ListenerDeclaration substate`
field and therefore uses a dedicated `ListenerRecord` struct that
satisfies the same `MrpAttributeLike` concept rather than reusing
`AttributeRecord<ListenerFirstValue>`.

## Participants

### `PortState` (generic, `mrp_participant.hpp`)

Composes the three per-port pieces that are shared across all
protocols:

- `TimerScheduler timers_`
- `leaveall_sm::Machine` / `Context`
- `periodic_sm::Machine` / `Context`

Plus event dispatch helpers that consume each FSM's side-effect
outputs and wire them back into the timer scheduler:

- `dispatch_leaveall(event, now)` — forwards `timer_restart` to
  `arm_leaveall()`
- `dispatch_periodic(event, now)` — forwards `timer_restart` to
  `arm_periodic()`

Per-attribute dispatch helpers (free templates constrained by the
`MrpAttributeLike` concept):

- `dispatch_applicant(rec, event, now)` — clears outputs then fires
- `dispatch_registrar(rec, event, now, timers)` — clears outputs, fires,
  then forwards `lvtimer_request` to `timers.start_leave()`
- `dispatch_applicant_tx(rec, now)` — automatically selects
  `TxRegistrarIn` vs `TxRegistrarMt` based on the paired Registrar's
  state (Clause 10.7.7 Note 8)

### `MsrpParticipant` (Clause 35, `msrp_participant.hpp`)

Holds one `PortState` plus four attribute vectors (TalkerAdvertise,
TalkerFailed, Listener, Domain). All capacities are resolved at
construction time via an explicit `MsrpConfig`:

```cpp
MsrpConfig cfg{
    .max_talker_advertise      = 16,
    .max_talker_failed         = 4,
    .max_listeners             = 16,
    .max_domains               = 2,
    .max_observers             = 4,
    .max_interesting_stream_ids = 16,
};
MsrpParticipant msrp{cfg};
```

Every container is `reserve()`d once during construction; the protocol
engine performs **zero heap allocations** on the steady-state TX / RX /
tick paths. Local declarations that would exceed a configured limit
return `TsnError::AttributeTableFull`; peer-observed attributes that
would exceed capacity are silently dropped (the peer's next periodic
cycle retransmits them if room later becomes available).

The outgoing PDU is built into a single fixed-size
`MutableBufferWithStorage<MAX_PDU_BYTES>` member owned by the
participant and reused on every TX pass — no per-call allocation for
the wire payload.

Exposes:

- **Local declaration API** — `declare_talker_advertise`,
  `declare_talker_failed`, `withdraw_talker`, `declare_listener`,
  `withdraw_listener`, `declare_domain`, `withdraw_domain`. Each
  returns `Status` that will be `TsnError::AttributeTableFull` if the
  backing table is at capacity.
- **Talker transmit authorization** — `listener_permits_transmit(stream_id)`
  returns `true` iff a peer listener declaration for this stream has
  been received with substate `Ready` or `ReadyFailed` *and* the
  Registrar for that peer record is in `In`. IEEE 802.1Q-2014
  Clause 35 forbids a talker from transmitting media frames until
  this predicate is true; use it to gate the audio pipeline.
- **Observer subscription** — `subscribe(Observer)` / `unsubscribe(id)`.
  `Observer` is a struct of `std::function` callbacks:
  - `on_talker_advertise(TalkerAdvertiseFirstValue, Operation)`
  - `on_talker_failed(TalkerFailedFirstValue, Operation)`
  - `on_talker_leave(StreamId)`
  - `on_listener(StreamId, ListenerDeclaration, Operation)`
  - `on_listener_leave(StreamId)`
  - `on_domain(DomainFirstValue, Operation)` / `on_domain_leave(DomainFirstValue)`
  The `Operation` argument distinguishes locally-declared attributes
  from peer-observed registrations.
- **PDU I/O** — `receive_pdu(span, now)` and `set_send_pdu(fn)`
- **Event loop** — `tick(now)` and `next_deadline()`
- **Interesting Stream ID pruning** — optional filter mirroring the
  `mrp.c` MSRP feature: when enabled, TalkerAdvertise / TalkerFailed
  attributes learned from peers are only retained if their `StreamId`
  is in the interesting set. Set methods:
  `set_pruning_enabled(bool)`, `add_interesting_stream_id(StreamId)`,
  `remove_interesting_stream_id(StreamId)`, `clear_interesting_stream_ids()`.

### `MvrpParticipant` (Clause 11.2, `mvrp_participant.hpp`)

Same shape as `MsrpParticipant` but with only a `VlanIdentifier`
attribute type and a smaller `MvrpConfig` (two fields: `max_vlans`,
`max_observers`). API surface:

- `declare_vlan(vid, now)` / `withdraw_vlan(vid, now)` — return
  `TsnError::InvalidVlanId` for out-of-range VIDs,
  `TsnError::AttributeTableFull` at capacity.
- `has_vlan(vid)` / `is_vlan_registered(vid)`
- Observer callbacks: `on_vlan_registered(vid, Operation)` /
  `on_vlan_leave(vid)`
- Same `receive_pdu` / `set_send_pdu` / `tick` / `next_deadline` shape
- Same zero-allocation steady state: attribute database, observer
  slots, and PDU build buffer are all reserved at construction.

## Event flow walkthrough

A full declare → peer notification → withdraw cycle:

1. **Local declare.**
   `a.declare_talker_advertise(fv, now)` — creates or updates the
   attribute record, fires `Applicant::New` (or `Join` if refreshing),
   starts the JoinTimer.
2. **Join timer expiry.**
   Caller's event loop observes `a.next_deadline()` has arrived,
   calls `a.tick(now)`. The scheduler reports the Join timer fired;
   the participant dispatches `TxRegistrarMt` (or `TxRegistrarIn`) to
   every attribute's Applicant, reads the resulting `tx_pending` /
   `send_msg` / `encode` outputs, and builds a PDU.
3. **PDU emit.**
   The built PDU is passed to the `send_pdu` callback installed by
   the caller. In a real deployment this writes to a raw Ethernet
   socket; in tests it enqueues into a `Fabric` helper.
4. **Peer receive.**
   On the other side, `b.receive_pdu(pdu, now)` walks the PDU
   structure (Clause 10.8.2: version, attribute list header, vector
   attribute headers, FirstValue, 3-packed events, 4-packed listener
   substates). For each attribute, it dispatches `RNew` / `RJoinIn` /
   `RJoinMt` / `RLv` etc. to both the Applicant and Registrar FSMs of
   the corresponding attribute record.
5. **Observer notification.**
   If the Registrar emits `notify = New | Join`, the participant calls
   every subscribed Observer's `on_talker_advertise` / `on_listener` /
   etc. with `Operation::Register`.
6. **Withdraw.**
   `a.withdraw_talker(stream_id, now)` fires `Applicant::Leave`,
   driving the attribute toward `La`. The next Join timer tick emits
   a PDU with an `Lv` wire event. On the peer side, the Registrar
   transitions `In → Lv` (with `lvtimer_request = true`, starting the
   LeaveTimer), and after the 1-second LeaveTimer expires, the
   Registrar transitions `Lv → Mt` with `notify = Leave`, and the
   observer's `on_talker_leave` fires.

## Key design decisions

- **`statusbar::sm` transition tables are pure constexpr** — no
  framework modifications were needed. The one cross-FSM coupling is
  handled by event variants dispatched by the driver, not by guard
  predicates or action return values.
- **Per-port, not multi-port.** Each NIC / port gets its own
  `MsrpParticipant` / `MvrpParticipant` instance, matching 802.1Q's
  "Applicant per port per attribute" model exactly.
- **Observer via `std::function` callbacks**, not virtual interface.
  Matches existing statusbar style; lets callers bind capture state
  into lambdas.
- **Timers via `tick()` + `next_deadline()`**, not OS timerfd. Caller
  owns the event loop and chooses poll/epoll/coroutines/etc.
- **Singleton vector encoding.** The participant emits one vector per
  attribute on transmit — no coalescing of contiguous stream IDs into
  a multi-value vector. Decode path handles multi-value receive
  correctly; encode coalescing can be added later if profiling shows
  PDU size is a concern.

## Testing

- **FSM-level tests** in `mrp_applicant_sm_test.cpp` and
  `mrp_registrar_sm_test.cpp` verify representative cells of each
  transition table against the ported `mrp.c` reference, including
  the critical `An` split cells and the p2pmac-collapse on `rJoinIn!`.
- **Integration tests** in `msrp_participant_test.cpp` exercise two
  participants back-to-back via a `Fabric` helper, covering
  declare→advertise→notify, withdraw→leave-timer→notify, listener
  declaration, interesting stream ID pruning, and observer
  subscription lifecycle.
