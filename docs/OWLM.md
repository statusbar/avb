# OWLM — One-Way Latency Measurement Tool

`owlm_tool` measures one-way UDP packet latency between two end
stations using gPTP-synchronized timestamps. Both sides send and
receive; each side maintains per-source latency statistics
(min/mean/p50/p95/p99/max, full histogram, packet loss).

Linux-only. Requires `CAP_NET_RAW + CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

The tool is a thin consumer of the **udptun** framework
(`statusbar/udptun`, see `docs/UDPTUN.md`). It supplies an `OwlmCodec`
adapter for the 32-byte OWLM measurement header and lets udptun own
the TX/RX scaffolding, redundancy tracking, reflector, and report
formatting. Other codecs (e.g. AAF v1 over IEEE 1722 Annex J for AVB
audio over UDP) plug into the same framework.

## Quick start (two nodes)

On node A (192.0.2.1):

```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=ep ./owlm_tool
./owlm_tool --gptp-interface=eth0 --peer=192.0.2.2 --tx-interval-us=1000
```

On node B (192.0.2.2):

```
./owlm_tool --gptp-interface=eth0 --peer=192.0.2.1 --tx-interval-us=1000
```

After ~10 s each side prints summary lines like:

```
[    10.001]
  eui64=00:11:22:FF:FE:33:44:55 count=10000 loss=0.00% \
    min=0.0ms mean=0.0ms p50=0.0ms p95=0.0ms p99=0.0ms max=0.1ms ooo=0 dup=0
  RTT count=10000 min=0.0ms mean=0.0ms p50=0.0ms p95=0.0ms p99=0.0ms max=0.2ms \
    sent=10000 loss=0.00% (0 missing sequence ids) recovered=0 true_loss=0.00% (0)
```

Press Ctrl-C to print the final summary including the full ASCII
histogram per source.

## Redundant dual-stream mode (default)

By default `owlm_tool` sends every TX opportunity twice: a *primary*
packet (EUI-64 mid bytes `00:00`) carrying the current sequence and gPTP
timestamp, and a *redundant* packet (mid `00:01`) replaying the
primary packet sent `--temporal-shift-ms` (default 10 ms) earlier. The
reflector echoes both copies. The receiver:

- only feeds primary echoes into the RTT histogram (the redundant
  echoes lag by exactly the temporal shift);
- runs both copies through a per-pair coverage tracker that classifies
  each sequence as *primary received*, *recovered* (primary lost,
  redundant arrived) or *true loss* (both copies lost).

The RTT line gains `recovered=R true_loss=Y% (T)` so you can see the
effective drop rate before and after redundancy.

Caveat: a single-NIC `owlm_tool` only protects against temporal
decorrelation (bursty losses up to ~`temporal-shift-ms` wide). For
true path-diversity redundancy (ST 2022-7 style), the two streams must
go over physically separate paths, which this tool does not yet do.

Pass `--no-redundant` to fall back to a single legacy stream (uses
`--id-mid`, no coverage tracker, no extra bandwidth).

## Presentation-time stamping (`--worst-case-latency-ms`)

`owlm_tool` stamps each packet with a *presentation time* (PT) rather
than the raw acquisition wall:

    PT = acquisition_wall + worst_case_latency_ms × 1e6

Default is 60 ms. Set it to the deployment's tolerated worst-case
one-way latency. This serves two purposes:

- **Receiver-side reordering is implicit.** The udptun receiver keys
  its primary/redundant coverage tracker by PT. Out-of-order primaries
  land in the slot indexed by their PT regardless of arrival order, so
  there is no seq-gap bookkeeping for redundancy accounting.
- **Lateness is a deadline-relative diagnostic.** The receiver displays
  `lateness = rx_wall - PT`. A deployment with WCL = 60 ms whose actual
  one-way transit is 50 ms shows lateness ≈ −10 ms (10 ms of headroom).
  Lateness > 0 means the packet missed the WCL deadline; lateness ≤ 0
  means it arrived on time. Real one-way transit = lateness + WCL — the
  operator computes it externally because both ends know WCL.

For self-loopback / reflector RTT measurement, the sender adds its own
WCL back to recover real RTT (`rtt = rx_wall - PT + WCL`), so the
displayed RTT is unaffected by the choice of WCL.

Pass `--worst-case-latency-ms=0` to recover the original "PT ==
acquisition wall" semantic (lateness ≡ real one-way transit).

## Running without gPTP (`--no-gptp`)

When there's no gPTP grand master on the segment (e.g. the RPi is
plugged straight into a consumer router, or you just want a quick RTT
sanity check), pass `--no-gptp`. Behaviour:

- the gPTP slave session is skipped entirely (no PHC, no raw sockets,
  no `CAP_NET_RAW`);
- packet PT (the `tx_gptp_ns` field) and `rx_gptp_ns` are read
  directly from `CLOCK_REALTIME`;
- TX/RX are always considered "synced" (there's no clock-rate bridge
  to wait for);
- the EUI-64 is built from the MAC of `--owlm-interface` (or
  `--gptp-interface` if the former is empty).

RTT measurement is fully accurate in this mode (same clock on both
the tx and rx stamps). For one-way measurement between two hosts the
two CLOCK_REALTIMEs need to be roughly in agreement — NTP is fine for
ms-scale work; don't expect µs accuracy without gPTP or PTP.

## IPv6 unicast

```
./owlm_tool --gptp-interface=eth0 --peer=fe80::1%eth1 --tx-interval-us=1000
```

The local bind family is inferred from `--peer`. For RX-only mode (no
`--peer`), pass `--ipv6` to bind the IPv6 wildcard. IPv6 multicast is
not yet supported.

## Reflect mode (round-trip latency)

For round-trip latency measurements without requiring gPTP synchronization
between the two endpoints — for example, probing a remote server from a
NATed home device — run a stateless reflector on the remote and a normal
sender locally:

On the remote (e.g. `reflex.statusbar.com`):

```
./owlm_tool --mode=reflect --local-port=9991
```

On the local sender:

```
./owlm_tool --gptp-interface=eth0 --peer=reflex.statusbar.com \
            --peer-port=9991 --tx-interval-us=100000
```

The reflector validates each datagram as a well-formed OWLM packet (magic,
version, reserved-zero, sender-synced) and bounces accepted datagrams
verbatim back to the source IP and port. Random non-OWLM traffic is
counted as `dropped_invalid` and not echoed. The response is the same
size as the request, so the reflector cannot be used as an amplification
vector.

The local sender detects its own EUI-64 in returning packets and records
them as RTT samples in a separate stats bucket from the per-source
one-way stats. Live reports include an extra line:

```
  RTT count=N min=…ns mean=…ns p50=…ns p95=…ns p99=…ns max=…ns
```

and the final summary additionally prints the RTT histogram. Reflect mode
itself does not require gPTP, but the local sender does — RTT timestamps
on the sender side use the same gPTP-rated clock as the one-way path, so
the rate calibration cancels across each round-trip interval.

## Multicast

```
./owlm_tool --gptp-interface=eth0 --peer=239.1.2.3 --mcast-ttl=2 \
            --tx-interval-us=1000 --dscp=46
```

`--dscp=46` (Expedited Forwarding) puts packets in the same QoS class
as AVB Class A streams — useful for quantifying queue delay in TSN
networks.

## Accuracy

Userspace timestamps are read from `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` immediately
before `sendto` and immediately after `recvfrom` returns, then
converted to the gPTP domain via `GptpTimeBridge`. Latency target on
a quiet wired Linux box: **±100 µs**. Sources of jitter:

- Kernel scheduling between `recvfrom` return and our timestamp call
- gPTP bridge offset / rate update granularity (sub-µs typical)
- Sender-side syscall path before the packet reaches the wire

Hardware timestamping on the UDP NIC is *not* used — its PHC drifts
independently of the gPTP NIC's PHC, and bridging across two PHCs
adds a second layer of conversion error. Future versions may add
`SO_TIMESTAMPING` (kernel software stamping) for a tighter floor.

## Wire format

32-byte fixed header, big-endian:

| Offset | Size | Field            |
|--------|------|------------------|
| 0      | 4    | magic = "OWLM"   |
| 4      | 2    | version = 1      |
| 6      | 2    | flags = 0        |
| 8      | 8    | sender_eui64     |
| 16     | 4    | sequence         |
| 20     | 8    | presentation_time_ns (`tx_gptp_ns` field) |
| 28     | 4    | tx_interval_us   |
| 32     | …    | optional payload pad |

Receivers drop datagrams whose magic, version, flags, length, or
interval are out of range. See `statusbar/owlm/owlm_packet.cpp` for
the canonical validation.

## Smoke test

`scripts/owlm/loopback_smoke.sh` runs two `owlm_tool` instances on
`lo` (with separate ports) for a few seconds and asserts packet
counts. Hand-run with:

```
OWLM_TEST_IFACE=eth0 ctest -R owlm_loopback
```

## CSV output for offline analysis

Pass `--csv-output=PATH` to `owlm_tool` to write a per-packet CSV at
session end. Schema (header row included):

```
rx_gptp_ns,presentation_time_ns,latency_ns,sender_eui64,sequence,interval_us,role
```

- `rx_gptp_ns` — receive-side master-clock timestamp.
- `presentation_time_ns` — tx-side stamped time on the wire.
- `latency_ns` — measured lateness (`rx_gptp − presentation + worst_case_latency [+ peer_tai_offset_ns]`).
- `sender_eui64` — lowercase hex with colons.
- `sequence` — codec wire sequence.
- `interval_us` — `announced_interval_us` from the codec.
- `role` — `remote_primary`, `remote_redundant`, `remote_legacy`,
  `self_primary`, `self_redundant`, `self_legacy`.

Records are streamed to disk continuously by a low-priority writer
thread fed through an SPSC ring (~48 B per record). The realtime
TX/RX path only enqueues into the ring — it never touches disk. The
ring depth (~3 MB / 65536 records) absorbs ~30 s of writer stalls at
2 krec/s; longer stalls (e.g. multi-second SD-card GC pauses) cause
records to be dropped and counted, and the drop count is printed on
stderr at exit when non-zero.

Analyze captured CSVs with `python/owlm/owlm_analyze.py`:

```
owlm_analyze.py join A.csv B.csv [--bin-width-us=250]
owlm_analyze.py plot A.csv [B.csv] -o plot.png [--window-ms=100]
owlm_analyze.py events A.csv \
    [--upper-threshold-ms=5] [--negative-threshold-ms=-1] -o events.csv
```

`events` streams the input (.csv / .csv.gz / .colbin) and emits one
row per outlier (filtered to remote_primary / remote_legacy roles, the
same scope `join`'s `min_ms` / `max_ms` come from). Each row has
`rx_gptp_ns`, a human-readable `rx_pdt`, `presentation_time_ns`,
`latency_ns`, `latency_ms`, `sender_eui64`, `sequence`, `interval_us`,
`role`, and a `direction` tag (`low` or `high`). A short preview is
printed to stdout. The legacy `--threshold-ms` flag is kept as an
alias for `--upper-threshold-ms`.

`plot` accepts optional extra inputs to extend the report with
wan-timer diagnostics and per-packet outlier panels. Each is
independent — pass any subset:

```
owlm_analyze.py plot A.parquet B.parquet -o report.pdf \
    --wake-csv-a A-wake.csv     --wake-csv-b B-wake.csv \
    --duration-csv-a A-dur.csv  --duration-csv-b B-dur.csv \
    --outliers-csv-a A-out.csv  --outliers-csv-b B-out.csv
```

The wake / duration CSVs are the outputs of owlm_tool's
`--wan-timer-wake-stats-csv` / `--wan-timer-duration-stats-csv`. Each
adds one bar-plot row (bin centres on x in µs, count on symlog y;
underflow / overflow tail counts shown in the title). The outliers
CSVs are the outputs of `owlm_analyze.py events`. Each adds two
rows per device: a scatter of latency vs session-time coloured by
direction, plus a histogram of outlier latencies split by direction.

The script is `uv`-runnable (PEP 723 inline metadata) — invoke
directly, no `pip install` needed.

## Run-duration and timer-histogram CSV

- `--duration-s=N` schedules a graceful shutdown after `N` wall-clock
  seconds from session start (fractional seconds allowed). The same
  drain, summary, and CSV flush path that runs on SIGINT runs at the
  deadline. `0` (default) keeps the current behavior: run until
  SIGINT / SIGTERM.
- `--wan-timer-wake-stats-csv=PATH` and
  `--wan-timer-duration-stats-csv=PATH` dump the realtime timer's
  wake-error and callback-duration histograms at end of run.
  Collected on every tick regardless of `--enable-tripwire`. Schema:
  ```
  bin_low_ns,bin_high_ns,count
  ```
  Underflow row leaves `bin_low_ns` empty; overflow row leaves
  `bin_high_ns` empty. Bin edges and width come from
  `--wan_timer.error_histogram.*` / `--wan_timer.duration_histogram.*`
  (defaults: −10 µs … +200 µs / 5 µs bins for wake error, 0 … +200 µs
  / 5 µs bins for callback duration). Only populated on the
  realtime-timer code path (gPTP slave or ptp4l with
  `--wan_timer.period_ns > 0`); polling fallback prints a warning and
  skips the CSV.
